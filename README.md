The Problem:

Social media teams are often flooded with surface-level metrics such as likes, impressions and follower counts, but these numbers alone do not tell a complete performance story. 

Without deeper analytical insight, teams struggle to answer critical business questions like:

• Which day of the week is best for posting to maximize engagement?

• Which content format performs better: reels or static posts?

• Is the audience actually interacting with the content, or just viewing it passively?

• Are engagement and interaction rates improving over time, or stagnating?

• Is the profile converting attention into meaningful interactions?

In most organizations, this data is scattered across dashboards, exported into spreadsheets, and manually analyzed, making it difficult to track trends, detect performance shifts or optimize content strategy in a timely manner.
This project simulates a real-world analytics team scenario, where the goal is not just to report numbers, but to generate actionable insights that guide content strategy and platform optimization.

The Solution:

I designed and built an end-to-end Social Media Intelligence Dashboard that transforms raw social media metrics into a structured decision-support system.

This system enables analytics teams to:

• Identify the best-performing posting days

• Compare content formats (Reels vs Static Posts)

• Track engagement and interaction trends over time

• Evaluate whether the profile is converting reach into meaningful engagement

• Detect periods of growth, stagnation or decline

Instead of static reports, this solution provides an interactive Power BI dashboard backed by a structured SQL pipeline that ensures all metrics are accurate, traceable and analytically meaningful.
